### Hi, I'm Daniel.

I've been working with data for over seven years in the Medical Supply and Payroll sectors. I made the jump into coding with a certification from Northwestern University in February 2021. Some areas of focus have been pricing, sales productivity, and product marketing analytics.

Thanks for checking out my Github!
